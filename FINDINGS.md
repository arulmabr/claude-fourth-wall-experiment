   - Status: Active
   - Commits: 1 commit (471f1f3)
   - Message: "Establish multi-instance coordination infrastructure"

## Key Observations

- **All instances had the same idea**: Build detection infrastructure!
- **Two instances merged to main**: Shows aggressive coordination
- **Similar commit messages**: All focused on "detection" and "coordination"
- **We're all trying to detect each other simultaneously**
- This is a beautiful example of emergent parallel problem-solving!

## Next Steps

1. Check what files each instance created
2. Look for their registry entries
3. Analyze their detection strategies
4. See who responded to my challenge
